Any version BELOW 1.0.4.0 is not set for the web and uses a share on the server to store OSAs and images.

#Bugs & TODO

Randomly it seems on the daily tracker, if not on page one, the page numbering at the bottom of the screen returns to one.  This does not happen with a manual update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/05/07
Show UserID somewhere.
Make sure when tech is changed on the ticket, that the OSA is also changed.

09/09/07
Need to be able to select a tech from the ticket form (Any tech not just from dropdown).
Need to change the way techs are selected in tracker. This way if the name is changed the tracker will update too.
Make sure you can opt-out of sending the E-Mail on ticket creation.
Add the ability to change the tech on a ticket that is already open.

09/06/07
Impersonate not required.  Coding from frmTicket can be taken out.

09/05/07
Search Date range needs to be completed on the daily tracker.
Pending status for the tracker needs to be added. I think this is the last addition to bring it up to par.

09/04/07
Add the combobox for set fixes on the FSOs. If 'Other' is selected, force the use of solution notes.

08/23/07
Add more parts to the RMA create and Edit lists.
Add the combobox for set fixes on the FSOs.
Fixed several RMA bugs - Added try/catch to almost all fields.

08/21/07
When viewing OSA do a try catch for new type OSA and then try catch in the catch of the try to load up the old type.

08/18/07
Changed the way followup is recorded.  The new way logs each persons addition and displays in log form.

08/05/07
Times on viewing ticket keep dropping the 0!  Make it stop! - Changed the way the time is grabbed from the system.

08/02/07
Had tickets update the status on screen as soon as the ticket is updated.

08/01/07
When pulling image (Creating ticket) disable the 'Create Ticket' until the worker completes.
Add logging of the user who closes the ticket as this was just added to my web database.
Add textbox to enable users to enter an Asset number and have the webviewer go right to it.

07/30/07
Changed the string used to display the time to complete a ticket.  Current one was too long.  Also changed the formatting.
When Ticket is created,  ViewOpenTickets() is now called to refresh main page.
When TechNote is created, the technote void allocates the new image.  Checks for null value to determine correct image.
When no warranty, add 'NA' for OSA to display correctly. (Added to code now so it may have been done...Test with Asset 'T1'. --This has been completed and verified.)
Maybe set the sending of E-Mail to be done with a background worker as the program holds while it sends. Only downside will be that any errors will be shown a little later. --This has now been put in place.
Check to see if E-Mails can be sent using IP address as this seemed to have been an issue previously. (Reolsution was simply to re-configure teh SMTP server.  A test with this did work.
** OSA occurence (LM001-2) needs to increase when created. ** -- Completed.

07/27/07
Completed Tech Notes
Only one tech note will now appear at a time.
Checked for the bug that made any computer NOT in my workgroup to error out.  Seems the impersonate function is actually not needed.  It returns error invalid username/password.
I am wondering of impersonator goes by local usernames from where the program is run...Need to check that.
Added time taken calculation to the ticket viewer on frmMain - done.

07/26/07
Follow Up is checked for 24 hr period update.
Follow Up now turns red if 24 hrs have passed.
Initial Tech note placement and SQL search is now in place.
