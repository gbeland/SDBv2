- Added validation for camera check folder. If the folder is not accessible, camera check form will not open.
- When a camera check is failed, a context menu is displayed with ticket symptoms that have been marked as "visible" to annotate the check.
- Added a server-side option to disable the ticketed group during camera checks.
- If a service reminder is present on the asset, the "SR" button will be yellow. (If the buttons are hidden, the asset name will be yellow.)
- If no images are available for a camera check, it is no longer possible to pass the check.
- A new option has been added to Settings which enables/disables automatic camera check updates and buttons on the main form. It is disabled by default. Employees that perform camera checks should enable this option.
- Slowed camera check refresh rate from 1 minute to 2 minutes.

Camera Check Audit:
- Images and details are now shown in a details pane on the Camera Check Audit form.
- Added columns "Image Name" and "Symptom" to report.
- The users list has been split so that it can be sorted by first or last name.
- The users list no longer lists deactivated user accounts.

Camera Check Review:
- Added validation for camera check folder. If the folder is not accessible, camera check review form will not open.
- Camera check reviews now include a brief note if one was entered during the check.
- When reverting a failed camera check to "Pass", the camera check submission is changed to the user reverting the failure (rather than the original user who submitted the camera check).

Customer/Market Editor:
- Added customer "Freeze" option which prevents tickets from being opened for that customer. (Admin-only option.)
- Added option to receive email notifications for RMA creation.
- Updated layout of the list of assets in the market. (Uses ObjectListView instead of ListView.)
- Options to delete customer or market are now admin-only.
- Market deletion now also checks for shipments that were assigned to a market before allowing deletion.
- Removed Customer Web Portal Login tab as web portal functionality is deprecated.
- "Frozen Account" indicator is shown when viewing a market that belongs to a customer whose account has been frozen.
- Added an open ticket list. Double-clicking an item in the list will view the ticket.

General Notes:
- Added a bit of padding to General Notes to avoid crowding.
- Slowed general note refresh rate from 1 minute to 5 minutes.
- General note refresh optimization: User names for general notes are retrieved in a single query instead of one-per-note.

Market List:
- Customers (and their markets) are shown in red in the Market List if the customer account is frozen.
- Set all columns to be visible by default.

Reports:
- Fixed a bug preventing RMA reports from being generated.

RMA Create:
- Added "Discarded" option to indicate when assembly is discarded by customer/tech and will not be received.
- When creating a new RMA, if the ticket is assigned to a tech other than the primary tech for the asset, a prompt to change the RMA assignee to the priority tech is shown.
- Added new option to send the market a notification for the RMA creation. If the option is changed to differ from the market preference, this is indicated by red color and a dialog.
- If the market is configured to receive RMA Creation email notifications, it is carbon-copied on the email that is sent to the assigned tech.

RMA Editor:
- The "Discarded" option appears on columns listing assemblies and is treated similarly to receive. Assemblies that are discarded appear in the repair tab to be assigned appropriate repair actions.
- A new button on the Receive Tab "Change to Discarded" allows an assembly to be marked as discarded rather than received. It still requires repair actions to be assigned to it.
- Receiving a discarded assembly will remove its discarded status and change it to a received assembly.
- After finishing repair on an assembly, the first unrepaired assembly in the list for the same RMA will be automatically selected.
- After finishing repair on the last assembly in an RMA, the search field will be automatically selected.
- Serial numbers for assemblies are now shown in a new column on the summary tab for finalization.
- Added "Status" to the top details, which indicates whether an RMA is Not received, Received, Pending, In Progress, Completed, Unshipped, Finalized, Expired, or Deleted.
- Creating a shipment for an RMA requires that the RMA be either APR or have at least one received/repaired assembly.

RMA List:
- Discarded assemblies count as received for practical purposes and will cause RMAs with discarded assemblies to appear on the received list.
- Fixed list display order by having MySQL perform the ordering instead of the ObjectListView. Columns can still be ordered as desired, but this fixes issues where "Hot" RMAs appear at the top of two pages, for example.

RMA Modify:
- If the RMA is changed to APR, a prompt to create a shipment for the RMA will now be shown.
- If the market is configured to receive RMA Creation email notifications, it is carbon-copied on the email that is sent to the assigned tech.

Shipment Editor:
- Shipments now always store destination address information instead of linking to market or tech. This is more compatible with upcoming UPS WorldShip integration, and preserves addresses for historical records (rather than always showing current address).
- Shipments now store the date at which time they were marked as ready.
- Shipment request/destination information can now be edited while on hold, but not after they have shipped. (A deleted shipment must be restored to edit; a shipped shipment must have shipment canceled to edit.)
- Journal entries now have the option to release shipment from hold.
- Selecting a market as a destination will now use the customer name for "Company" and the market name for "Attn" as market names are not necessarily suitable company names.
- The state/province field is no longer required during validation as some international addresses do not have/use this value.
- Administrators can shift-click the "Edit" button at top which unlocks the ledger for editing, even if the shipment has been picked or shipped. This allows RMA and ticket numbers to be associated or serial numbers to be added.
- Assemblies added to a shipment now require a custom job number if the asset parts warranty/contract has expired.
- When adding an assembly to a shipment, selecting custom job number will clear the job number originally obtained from the asset.
- When adding an assembly to a shipment, if the assembly type specifies a serial number format, a serial number matching the format must be provided.
- When adding an assembly to a shipment, multiple serial numbers are allowed for quantities over 1. If the assembly type specifies a serial number format, serial numbers must conform.
- When modifying an assembly on a shipment, multiple serial numbers and quantities can be specified.
- Assemblies with serial numbers appear as individual line items with quantity 1. Assemblies without serial numbers in multiple quantities are not separated into individual line items.
- Fixed a bug where serial number validation was not enforcing start and end of string. (For example [0-9]{5} would unintentionally match a 6-digit serial number.) End-users do not need to add start and end characters (^, $) as they are now embedded.
- All of the following functions have been moved to a "Shipment Options" menu at the top of the shipment editor: Create, Hold, Release, Delete, Restore, Export, Print

Shipment List:
- Listed shipments incorrectly showed the number of line items rather than the total assembly quantity. This has been fixed.
- Searching for a shipment by ID will open the shipment in the editor rather than displaying one search result in the list.
- Pressing ESC will now close the Shipment List.
- The shipment list now has first and last page buttons when there is more than one page in the list.
- Fixed a bug which marked the wrong radio button when the list is first shown.

Tech Editor:
- Address field max length increased from 50 to 64 to match database.
- City field max length increased from 30 to 40 to match database.
- State field max length increased from 2 to 3 to match database.
- Zip field max length decreased from 15 to 10 to match database.
- Country field max length increased from 32 to 40 to match database.
- Shipping address field max length increased from 50 to 64 to match database.
- Shipping city field max length increased from 30 to 40 to match database.
- Shipping state field max length increased from 2 to 3 to match database.
- Shipping zip field max length decreased from 15 to 10 to match database.
- Shipping country field max length increased from 32 to 40 to match database.
- Fixed a bug that prevented tech deletion.
- The "Ship to Mailing Address" option is now checked by default when adding a new tech.
- Fixed a bug where the shipping state would incorrectly copy the mailing city.
- Email field is now checked for valid email addresses.

Ticket Create:
- When sending email (Supervisor override, Open, OSA), exceptions are now caught (such as invalid characters in email addresses) and logged to the ticket journal.
- The Ticket Create form has been enlarged and redesigned.
	- Asset labor warranty/contract is used to determine OSA eligibility, not ticket type.
	- Asset Service Reminder is shown and can be copied to the OSA notes via a button.
	- Asset notes are also shown for reference.
	- Symptom list has been made larger.
	- Option to send OSA has been removed. Creating a ticket with an OSA will always send OSA email.
	- Tickets in general can opened without assigning a tech, in the case of no OSA. (In the database, tickets can have a null tech_id reference, meaning that no tech was assigned an OSA.)
	- The option to send the market an Open email notification is set according to the market preference. If changed from market preference, it is indicated by color and a dialog.
- When a ticket without an OSA is created, removed the "User declined to send OSA" journal message.

Ticket Editor:
- All of the following functions have been moved to a "Ticket Options" menu at the top of the ticket editor:
	- Ticket operations: Delete, Restore, Hold, Release, Convert to/from Monitoring
	- Email operations: Send OSA, Send Market Open, Send Market Close
- Journal entries now have the option to release ticket from hold.
- Creating an OSA or changing techs provides the opportunity to modify the OSA notes.
- When closing a ticket and sending a close email notification, exceptions are now caught (such as invalid characters in email addresses) and logged to the ticket journal.
- When sending a tech an OSA email, exceptions are now caught (such as invalid characters in email addresses) and logged to the ticket journal.
- When sending a market an open or close email, exceptions are now caught (such as invalid characters in email addresses) and logged to the ticket journal.
- When sending a tech an OSA email, the "Ticket Open" image (if available) is now included with the OSA.
- Asset details have been adjusted:
	- Asset name is bold for improved visibility.
	- Location information is now combined in a multi-line textbox which shows location, facing, address (if different from location), city, state, and country.
	- Customer and market are combined; clicking still opens the market view.
	- Service Reminder text has been added. Clicking it will open the Service Reminder editor.
	- A small warranty/contract status indicator has been added.
	- A ticket history pull-down menu has been added. Clicking it will load the ticket history.
- Improved speed when loading a ticket. The check for unreceived RMAs by the assigned tech is now on a separate thread.
- When closing a ticket for an asset with a service reminder, there is now only one prompt to clear or modify it.
- When closing a ticket that is on hold, the hold is canceled automatically before closing. This prevents some problems calculating hold vs active times in the database.
- Ticket hold expiration detail is shown below the ticket number for held tickets.
- When closing a ticket, the close email no longer has Lamar-specific wording for ticket closure. ("Would like to close..." instead of "Has closed...")
- When re-opening a ticket, the user is now prompted to send a market re-open email and a tech OSA email (if tech assigned).
- Email for ticket open/close/re-open/tech on-site notifications has been modified to use the asset name if the panel is blank.
- The VNC shortcut button now is enabled only if the asset has a network address and a VNC password.
- Double-clicking an RMA could result in a null reference exception if the object in the list wasn't fully loaded in time. The object is now checked for validity first.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the creation of a new OSA document, which happened when the OSA had been used in an outbound email message. (The email queue engine now disposes the message when sending is complete.)

Ticket List:
- Added Asset column.

Ticket Tracker:
- Ticket number is colored by status: Red = open with OSA; Light Purple = open without OSA; Gray = Held; Green = Closed
- Asset name is colored by status: Black = Labor is covered; Light Purple = Labor not covered


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-04-21 1.9.0.7

SDB Curator:
- The notification area icon has been updated.

General:
- Camera Check Due (CC Due), Camera Check Fails (CC Fails), and Notifications buttons now flash slowly when new items are first available, and faster as time passes.
- Documents used by the SDB are now in a "Required Files" subfolder in the application folder instead of in the application folder itself.
- If any RMA repair sessions are in progress by the user, a prompt to end them is shown when closing the SDB or logging out. Repair sessions are automatically ended if user proceeds with logout.
- The "Create Ticket" box at top right of the main form has been removed. Users must open tickets from the Asset Editor, Tickets tab. This allows users to see the ticket history and decide whether to re-open a closed ticket before opening a new one.
- Fixed a bug when searching for tickets by date range (does anyone ever do that?).
- Journals throughout the database now show expiration details for each entry.

Camera Check Audit:
- When exporting audit results to a file, the default filename is "Camera Check Audit" rather than "RMA List".
- Fixed a minor bug when attempting to set the "Last N Days" value higher than the number of days the report allows.

Camera Check Review:
- Admins and Moderators can now revert a failed camera check to pass. Standard users are prompted for supervisor override.
- If a camera check is already covered by a ticket at the time a second user attempts to review it, it will be ignored if the ticket was already open. If the second user creates a new ticket, a dialog warning about the first ticket is shown. (This should be rare as ticket locks for assets already exist.)
- Camera check review counts now consider only the last 3 days of data for efficiency/speed. (If a camera check review hasn't been covered in 3 days, it effectively goes away.)
- The camera check review form now closes automatically when the last review is complete.

RMA Editor:
- The Job Number and PO Number radio buttons should no longer ever both appear selected at once. (Viewing an RMA with a PO followed by viewing one with a Job Number would cause both to appear selected.)
- The "Start/Stop" repair button now has the word "Session" added to it to help make it more obvious that repair sessions are separate from the concept of "assembly is or is not fully repaired".
- If RMA has more than one assembly, a system journal entry is added to associated ticket when the first assembly is received.
- When all assemblies have been received, a system journal entry is added to associated ticket.
- Completing repairs and finalizing (or causing an RMA to not be finalized or complete) will automatically add a system journal entry to associated ticket. If associated ticket is on hold, the hold will be canceled.
- Additional journal entries are now automatically added when an assembly is repaired or repairs to an assembly are canceled.
- Additional journal entries are now automatically added when an assembly is finalized or finalization is canceled.

RMA Modify:
- Any unfinished repair sessions for an RMA are removed when deleting an RMA. (Note that repair details are retained, but incomplete session time is not.)
- Modifying an RMA (adding assemblies, removing assemblies, Hold, Release, Delete, Restore) will automatically add a system journal entry to associated ticket. If associated ticket is on hold, the hold will be canceled.
- Additional journal entries are now automatically added to the RMA for the above-listed RMA modification actions.

Shipment Editor:
- The "Weight" field maximum value is now 10000 lbs instead of 100 lbs.
- Modifying a shipment (Ready, Cancel Ready, Hold, Release, Delete, Restore, Pick, Cancel Pick, Ship, Cancel Ship) will automatically add a system journal entry to all associated tickets. If any associated tickets are on hold, the hold will be canceled.
- Items in the ledger that link to tickets, assets and RMAs were not clickable if the shipment was deleted or on hold. This has been changed so that these links can still be clicked.

Shipment List:
- The requested, picked, and shipped dates now include the time and the columns are wider.

Tech Editor:
- The "Unreceived RMA Warning" no longer includes Expired RMAs, and only appears if RMAs are unreceived after 30 days (down from 90).

Ticket Editor:
- When changing techs, the initial camera image (if present) is now properly attached to the new OSA email if the user chooses to send a new OSA email.
- The "Unreceived RMA Warning" no longer includes Expired RMAs, and only appears if RMAs are unreceived after 30 days (down from 90).
- The "Unreceived RMA Warning" button flashes more slowly and is yellow instead of red.
- The "Create Shipment" button is back on the Shipments tab, but now checks if RMAs are associated with ticket and prompts user to create a shipment from an RMA instead if the shipment is related to an RMA.
- The tab control and Solution section have changed places. The tab control has been made slightly wider to accommodate journal entry expirations.
- The "Hold" and "To Monitoring" buttons have been moved to the top control bar.
- The default time for putting a ticket on hold is now 8 hours (up from 2).

Ticket Tracker:
- Tickets that have "Other" as a symptom now properly show the description for "Other" in the symptom column.
- If the ticket category being viewed is changed, the tracker will scroll to the top. (Instead of trying to maintain scroll position on a different list.)


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-28 1.9.0.6

Camera Check:
- Additional tweaks to avoid concurrency issues when auto-submitting.
- Emergency fix for compounding complexity of camera check queries to database.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-23 1.9.0.5

** KNOWN ISSUE: THIS VERSION RUNS EXTREMELY SLOW CAMERA CHECK QUERIES WHICH CAUSES EXCESSIVE MYSQL CPU USAGE **

Database:
- Added table asset_camera_check_lock to handle camera check locks (concurrency)

Camera Check:
- Changed camera check requests to never show camera checks that are already requested and have not expired. This ultimately was a Bad Idea .
- Added concurrency management through a locking mechanism. When requesting a camera check, if another is currently in progress, the engine waits to obtain the lock then proceed.

Camera Check Audit:
- Results are now sorted by asset then submit datetime.
- Date selectors limited to 7 days due to number of records to parse.
- Rearranged date range selectors and added radio button selection of range versus last N days.
- Fix a bug where selecting zero users or markets would cause an exception.
- Added an option to only show failed camera checks.

RMA Editor:
- Expanded form width to accommodate asset and ticket info. This form is due for a redesign.

RMA Modify:
- Deleting an assembly will now properly remove repairlog entries for that assembly.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-22 1.9.0.4

General:
- The file "Checklist.pdf" has been renamed to "OSA_Checklist.pdf" but outbound email was not updated to use the new name. This has been fixed.

Asset Editor:
- Validation for monitoring and camera check intervals was using incorrect information, which prevented users from setting camera check intervals to 0, for example. This has been fixed.

Camera Check:
- Fixed a bug where the most recently submitted camera checks were appearing at the top of the list of due checks instead of at the bottom as intended.
- When first loading the Camera Check form, the preselected camera check type (Normal, Ticketed, Blackout) will automatically select the first type with more than zero to check.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-21 1.9.0.3

General:
- Modified installation to automatically launch SDB after install or update without using the Restart project.

Camera Check:
- Fixed another bug related to camera check padding interval which prevented camera checks from being retrieved.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-21 1.9.0.2

Camera Check:
- Fixed a bug when camera check intervals are less than the padding interval (currently < 10 min), camera check due and failed counts cause an exception.

Shipment List:
- Added a button to create new shipments (for parts orders).


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-21 1.9.0.1

Admin:
- Fixed an exception which resulted when the admin activity form tried to update even after being closed.

Asset Editor:
- New assets default to 60 minute camera check intervals instead of 0.

Camera Check Review:
- Fixed a bug which prevented previous items from being cleared upon closing and reopening the form.

Shipment Editor:
- When canceling the Shipped status of a shipment, a reason must be provided. This is automatically entered in the journal and is no longer a system message.
- When canceling the Picked status of a shipment, a reason must be provided. This is automatically entered in the journal and is no longer a system message.

Ticket Tracker:
- Adjusted alignment of last journal update to be top-aligned vertically.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-03-15 1.9.0.0

SDB Curator:
- Added asset names to summary email in addition to RMA numbers.
- Added Reply-To address to settings and removed hard-coded reply-to address.

Database
- Added column 'deleted_date' to rma and tickets tables.
- Added column 'camera_check_interval' to assets table.
- Added asset_camera_check table to support camera check functionality.

General
- The settings form will no longer cause an exception when saving if there are no printers installed (RMA bin and zone printer selections).
- Application version is included in troubleshooting log.
- Rebranded to Prismview (icons, installation path, references throughout forms and documents, etc.)
- Added Camera Check and Camera Check Review forms.
- Added Camera Check Due (CC Due) and Camera Check Fails (CC Fails) buttons which indicate when camera checks are due or have failed and require review.
- IP Address of client is recorded during login.

Asset Editor
- When geocoding an asset location, the address is used (as long as it is not blank) instead of the location.
- The asset address field was not properly being populated when loading assets. This has been fixed.
- Added camera check interval to monitoring tab.
- Camera check interval value must be greater than monitoring interval. An error is shown if this is not the case.
- Removed "Create Shipment" button from shipments tab.

Camera Check/Review/Audit
- Camera check form shows latest images from PVM for assets that have active labor warranty or contract and a webcam installed. It allows users to pass/fail the images and logs the event.
- There are three options for camera checks:
	- Normal: Shows images for assets which are not in blackout nor have tickets.
	- Ticketed: Shows images for assets which currently have tickets open, regardless of blackout status.
	- Blackout: Shows images for assets which are currently in blackout and do not have tickets.
- Camera Check review form shows all camera checks which have failed and do not have a ticket open to cover them. It allows users to assign an existing ticket or open a new ticket to cover the camera check failure.
- Camera Check audit form allows submitted camera checks to be queried in by customer or user and exported as a report.

Reports
- Fixed a bug that prevented Ticket Reports from running properly when selecting specific customers and assets.

RMA Editor
- When printing bin labels, a dialog is shown only if warnings or errors occur.
- The Asset and Ticket details have been moved to a sidebar that is shown on-demand.
- The RMA Journal is now always visible. The Journal has been moved to the space Asset and Ticket details used to occupy and the Journal Tab removed.
- Deleting an RMA now also records the deletion date.
- The Finalize button on the summary tab should now be visible to all user types.
- Added "SN Search (History)" button to Repair tab, which allows quick access to Serial Number search.
- Added "Inventory Move" button to Repair tab, which allows quick access to RMA Inventory Move form.
- The old receive location (zone and area) for assemblies that are not yet migrated to bins is now shown in "Inventory Location."

RMA List
- The "Review" list is available to all user types.
- Added "Move Items" button to allow quick access to RMA Inventory Move form.

RMA Modify
- When removing an unreceived assembly from an RMA, the warning about removing associated work and repair notes is no longer shown.

Ticket Editor
- Deleting a ticket now also records the deletion date.
- Fixed a bug where exporting a ticket would fail if child objects such as RMAs had not been populated yet.
- Removed "Create Shipment" button from shipments tab.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-01-22 1.8.7.56

RMA Editor
- Fixed a bug which prevented the form from allowing navigation and edits after viewing a deleted RMA.
- Fixed a bug which caused User Handles to increase when general notes refreshed. This eventually led to the application crashing.

RMA List
- The pagination controls stay in the correct location when resizing the form.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-01-21 1.8.7.55

Ticket Editor
- Fixed a bug that prevented ticket closure when a solution requires parts but the RMA data had not been loaded for the ticket.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-01-20 1.8.7.54

Database
- Added column 'is_default' to rma_zones table.
- Removed table 'weather_types'.
- Removed column 'weather_type' from tickets table.
- Added columns 'address', 'zip', 'indoor', 'access_notes', and 'retired' to assets table.
- Renamed column 'addnotes' to 'notes' in assets table.
- Renamed column 'addnotes' to 'notes' in techs table.
- Modified the following tables: 'techs', 'assets', 'markets', 'rental_divisions', 'shipments', and 'salespeople' to have consistent length fields for the following field types: address, city, state, zip, country.

General
- Updated ObjectListView control to version 2.9.0.25611.
- When an RMA is created, the email sent to ASCs now includes the Asset and Panel name.
- The "Refresh" menu item was moved to the View menu. The hotkey, F5, remains the same.

Administrative
- RMA Area and Zone editor now allows a zone to be specified as default. This is the default zone for new bins. Bins cannot be created without a default zone specified.

Asset Editor
- The asset name has been moved to the top left to be consistent with other editors (customer and market moved down).
- Added Geographic Location section which has all properties related to location of asset.
- Physical Specifications has been split into two via a tab control. Geographic Location is now a separate section accessible via this tab control.
- Added Indoor specification to Physical Specifications.
- Added Address field to Geographic Location. This field is used to store the physical address of the asset (rather than the cross-streets) and should be a proper address that can be geocoded.
- Added Zip field to Geographic Location. This field is used to identify the zip or postal code where the asset is located and is often needed for internet service, etc.
- Updated tooltips for Location and Address fields.
- Added Access Notes to the notes tab. These are included automatically when sending an OSA and serve to provide ASC with special access instructions (parking, security, access, allowed hours, etc.)
- A new option for Assets, "Retire" has been added. This is intended to be used when an asset no longer exists but needs to be kept in the database for historical reasons. A retired asset prevents new tickets, RMAs, or shipments from being created for it.
- Asset Options buttons at top consolidated into a dropdown menu. (Add New, Retire and Delete)

Reports
- Selecting a specific repair type when running an RMA report will no longer result in an error. Note that the numbers of assemblies reported are only those which meet the selected criteria.

RMA Editor
- When receiving assemblies, once the last assembly has been received, the RMA Number Search field is automatically selected.
- When receiving assemblies, you cannot create a new Bin unless a default zone has been specified in the RMA Areas and Zones configuration.

RMA Inventory
- Moving an assembly to the bin it is already in, or a bin to a zone it is already in, will result in an error message.
- Added a new feature, "Serial Number Search" which provides basic history for a given serial number.

RMA List
- Moved Inventory tab to a new form, accessible from the main menu under RMA > Inventory.

RMA Migration
- When migrating assemblies, you cannot create a new Bin unless a default zone has been specified in the RMA Areas and Zones configuration.

Tech Editor
- If the tech has RMAs with assemblies unreceived after 90 days, a flashing button is displayed. Clicking the button shows a summary of the unreceived RMAs.
- Extra tabs now load as-needed instead of all at once. (Lists of assigned assets, RMAs, Shipments, Tickets, etc.)
- The RMA tab has additional fields which show the total number of assemblies assigned to the tech, the number and percentage of them that have been received, and the average number of days to receive the first assembly on each RMA.
- The RMA list now has a filter selector which lets you view RMAs assigned to the tech categorized as: Unreceived, Received, Completed, Finalized or All.

Ticket Editor
- The Issue Number can now be changed by clicking the "Issue" label and assigning a new issue number.
- Weather types have been removed.
- If the assigned tech has RMAs with assemblies unreceived after 90 days, a flashing button is displayed in the OSA section. Clicking the button shows a summary of the unreceived RMAs.
- Extra tabs now load as-needed instead of all at once. (Lists of RMAs, Rentals, RMAs, Shipments, etc.)

Ticket Tracker
- The new ObjectListView version overrides custom formatting when using Hyperlinks. To avoid this, Hyperlinks are no longer used. When clicked, cells will open the relevant item as always, but the cursor does not change nor is the item underlined on hover.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-01-07 1.8.7.53

Database
- Added index `TIMESTAMP_IX` (`timestamp`) to eventlog table.
- Dropped index `fname` from users table.
- Added 'id' to rma_bin_history table.

General
- Changed default email authentication settings for new installations to the current values.

Administrative
- Improved query performance on Activity Panel.
- Moved the Pause button to globally affect all tabs on the Activity Panel.

Asset Editor
- The username and password are now URL encoded when clicking the camera network address. Previously this feature relied on the browser to recognize and parse this.

RMA Editor
- The "Repair Notes" field now accepts Enter to create newline (instead of requiring Control+Enter).

Ticket Editor
- The journal entry made when a tech arrives on site is now a system entry. It still expires in 60 minutes.
- The journal entry made when a tech departs is now a system entry. It still expires immediately.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-01-05 1.8.7.52

Ticket Tracker
- Fixed a bug where held tickets were also being shown in the open list.


=====================================================================================================================================================
2016-01-04 1.8.7.51

General
- Added stack trace detail to error log.

Ticket Tracker
- Fixed issues with monitoring and closed tickets not including tech on site or rental equipment details.

    When opening a ticket, if the form is still trying to get the webcam image and the new ticket is canceled, the webcam thread will now cancel without bringing up a notice.
    The RMA Job Log "Date Returned" field was displaying incorrectly though writing to the database was correct. Also the date used for part 1 was being incorrectly shown on all 5 parts. This has been fixed.

=====================================================================================================================================================

2011-10-27 1.5.0.5

SDB 1505 Changes

    Supervisor override emails sent when opening a ticket now include the additional following information:
        Whether the ticket was opened, re-opened, or converted from monitoring.
        Whether the OSA email is being sent (applies only to opened)
        Whether the Open email is being sent (applies only to opened)
    When searching for tickets/issue numbers, a dialog will indicate if only deleted tickets matched the search.
    The ticket tracker was showing expiring colors for tickets that had not been updated in 4+ hours but had expirations set. This has been fixed.
    When deleting a part from the parts configuration, if the part is used in any shipments or tickets, it is disabled. Otherwise a delete confirmation is shown. This differs from the previous functionality in which a part was only disabled.
    Adding a part in the parts configuration checks to see if a new part has already been added but unmodified.
    Fixed an additional problem with outgoing OSA emails with attachments causing them to require multiple attempts.
    Fixed a problem with outgoing OSA emails with image attachments where the image attachment does not show up in the email client.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-10-26 1.5.0.4

Version 1.5.0.4 of the Yesco Service Database is now current.

This update addresses the following bugs:

    Viewing RMA's as PDF's would fail whenever the RMA did not have a ticket linked. The new RMA model expects a ticket number to always be present, however RMA's without a ticket number would fail to render as PDF. Now the ticket number is checked before assuming it is present.
    Asset Warranty: Datetime fields automatically use current datetime when first entered. Due to tab order, the install date was automatically being entered when the form loaded. The cancel button is now selected when the form loads, so none of the datetime fields get automatically populated other than the data belonging to the asset.
    If an asset has no specified labor warranty or contract expiration date, it is treated as if expired.
    The ticket journal font size can now be specified in settings.
    Ticket Editor: Vendor invoicing notes is now properly shown and updated.
    Asset Editor: Notes are now properly being updated when changed.
    Shipments: Deleted shipments were showing up in the open shipments list as well as in search results. They are now only shown in the deleted list or if the shipment number is explicitly searched for.
    Shipments: Shipments are now shown in the list with the following colors:
        Black: Open
        Blue: Picked
        Green: Shipped/Closed
        Red: Deleted
    
    Shipments: When adding items to shipments, you can specify that the part is independent of an RMA, Ticket or Asset, and are prompted for the Job Number. This is used for shipping parts that are for purposes other than Asset related (such as restocking another Division, or for things we are shipping internally such as outside warranty repair).

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-10-26 1.5.0.3

Version 1.5.0.3 of the Yesco Service Database is now current.

This update addresses the following bugs:

    Email sending was broken. Yes, it was my fault. We harassed Latif in IT, checked the Gmail account settings, and everything, too. It was having a problem sending email because attachments were thrown away by the .NET garbage collector prematurely. Basically I was being too obsessed with cleaning up resources, and when the email sender went to send the email, the attachments were being yanked by the garbage man, causing a ruckus in the office. Imagine Steve Carrell in The Office trying to put a letter into an envelope, but the janitor trying to pull it from his hands to haul it out with the garbage. That's what was happening. It should be working happily now.
    When adding a new asset, the market list was allowing selection of a customer without specifying a market. This causes new assets to disappear into the void. It now requires that a market be selected.
    The shipped and installed date field labels on the asset editor were swapped. They've been swapped back as they should have been.


Also, a quick update to Dashboard fixes the issue where single assets cannot be viewed when a ticket is open for them.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-10-25 1.5.0.2

Version 1.5.0.2 of the Yesco Service Database is now current.
This contains a minor fix to 1.5.0.1 where in some lists there is 1 fewer item than should be (for example, tickets for an asset, or RMA's for a tech).

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-10-24 1.5.0.0

1.1.4.8+ versions have been skipped.

This update is a major overhaul to shipping. In addition, multiple tables have been edited and certain aspects of the GUI changed to utilize them.
Changed from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.0.

Major Feature Changes:

Shipments Overhaul
The old shipping system has been replaced with an updated, more integrated shipments system. Instead of creating a shipper form and printing/sending it via email, shipments are requested, fulfilled, and managed within the database.

A shipment can contain multiple items that are tied to various tickets, assets, and RMAs. Instead of having a shipment simply list these references, the items themselves are linked to their respective origins. For example an LED Board on a shipment will show its respective RMA, ticket, asset, and job number (from the asset parts warranty or contract).

Shipments are picked and fulfilled from within the database by the shipping department, and feedback about the shipment is easily viewed from any of the objects it links to. For example, if a shipment contains a part for ticket 12345, you can see the shipment as a link when viewing ticket 12345, as well as the shipment tracking number, if it has been shipped.

Future plans are integration with UPS WorldShip and other enhancements to make requesting and tracking progress of shipments much easier. The changes in this version enable such integration.

Dynamic Data Linking
Throughout the database are reusable elements such as shipment methods, ticket symptoms and solutions, and parts (for repair, shipping, etc.). These elements have typically been troublesome for upgrades and reporting, due to early database structure. These have been reworked and are now fully dynamic, allowing for better reporting information and future administrative changes without software updates. For example, this change allows tickets to be closed with multiple solutions as applicable.

Interface Update
To make better use of changes to shipments and forthcoming changes to RMAs, the user interface has been updated to include linked elements. For example, when viewing an asset, the following items can be easily seen: Assigned Techs, Ticket History, RMAs and Shipments.

In redesigning the interface, some additional information has been added to various items. For example, latitude and longitude are now included with asset information.

Search Improvements
Every editor (ticket, asset, tech) now has an incorporated search option which performs a slightly wider search than just the name/number of the object being searched. For example, when searching from the ticket editor, ticket numbers as well as customer issue numbers will be searched. This is the same functionality for the search tool panel to the right of the main window. The Search All function will additionally search fields such as location and contact names. For example, if you remember a field tech named Albert, but don't remember the tech company he is with, you can search for Albert to search contact names for techs.

Full Change Log:
General
- Auto-update and startup time reduced by removing some connection checks.
- Settings format updated. Initial launch will convert existing settings to XML format.
- Additional settings implemented:
- Dashboard URL
- Option to use internal web viewer or system default browser for HTTP links
- Path to TightVNC executable
- Timeout for VNC auto-password
- Default zoom level for Google Map views
- General Notes are now persistent but allow administrators to delete.
- Log off is now available from Administration menu.
- A status bar has been added showing login status, auto-refresh time, and email queue status.
- Removed "Manually Add Ticket" from Administration menu.
- Removed "Add/Delete Asset/Tech" from Administration menu. These options are available for administrators on the Asset and Tech editor tabs.
- Removed " Deleted Tickets" from the View menu.

Email
- All outgoing email from the database is now routed through an outbound queue. The status is shown in the status bar in the lower right.
- Outgoing email is attempted three times before giving up.
- Success and failure of outgoing email is automatically logged to the ticket journal which it belongs to.

Shipments
- New shipments form implemented. (View > Shipments)
- The shipments form remembers its location after closing and reopening the application.
- Shipments form divided in three sections:
- Search: Allows searching for shipments by Shipment Number, Job Number, RMA Number, Asset, Tech/Subcontractor, Customer/Market, or Date Range
- Detail: Shows full detail on a particular shipment. Also used to create new shipments.
- List: Shows shipments in the system: Open, Closed, Deleted, All, or the results from a search.

Parts
- Parts management added. (Administration > Configure > Parts)
- Parts allow selection of parts by any screen that uses them, and keeps part numbers and descriptions together to eliminate the need to cross-reference them. Also stores the location, cost and inventory quantity of parts for the shipping department.
- Parts are now incorporated into shipments and tickets. Will be implemented in RMA next update.

Ticket Tracker
- A pull-down menu for jumping to a specific ticket page has been added.
- A control bar has been added (yellow bar at top of data section), consistent with other interface updates.
- The number of tickets for the selected ticket type is shown in the control bar.
- The ticket type is selectable from radio buttons in the control bar.
- Total time elapsed for each ticket is shown below the open date .
- Each ticket displays its last follow-up (now called "Journal") with a color to indicate its age.  By default the following apply:
- Over 4 hours: Yellow
- Over 8 hours: Orange
- Over 24 hours: Red
- Expired: Red (new)
- When adding a journal entry to any ticket, an option has been added to specify an expiration time. Specifying an expiration will prevent the ticket tracker from using the default color scheme, instead showing red only after the entry has expired. Additionally, this can be used for shorter events, causing red (expiration) to occur before 24 hours.
- Clicking on the location of an asset within the ticket tracker will open the map view showing the asset location. Note that this only applies to assets with latitude and longitude coordinates.

Creating Tickets
- Local weather field added to ticket creation.
- Symptoms list can be expanded by administrators.
- A "ticket lock" feature has been added which will show when a ticket is being created against an asset. For example, if one user begins opening a ticket for an asset, but is not finished yet, if a second user tries to open a ticket for the same asset, a dialog will be presented indicating that a ticket is in progress. The second user may elect to continue (in the event it is desirable to create two tickets for an asset at the same time) but in most cases it is assumed that the ticket was being created for the same purpose and the second user can simply cancel. When the first user completes ticket creation the "lock" is removed.
- Technicians/Subcontractors that have been set to "Do Not Use" will not appear in the tech select menu when creating tickets.
- The street location, city and state of the asset will also include latitude and longitude coordinates (if available) on the OSA.

Ticket Editor
- The ticket editor has been redesigned to include dynamic data linking.
- Tickets now support multiple solutions.
- Solutions list can be expanded by administrators.
- All tickets now require solution notes, not just those using "Other" for a solution.
- Solutions such as "Replaced x" will require a parts inventory be included. The parts inventory is explained below. 
- Monitoring and Pending options have been changed to buttons that clearly indicate whether the ticket is to be put into Monitoring or Pending, or cancel either.
- The "Send E-Mail" button has been split into "Send Open", "Send Close" and "Send OSA" buttons located near the applicable section.  Clicking "Send Open" will prompt for whether to use the original ticket open time or the current time.
- If the ticket is not Closed, "Send Closed" is disabled.
- If the ticket is Monitoring, "Send OSA" is disabled.
- The "Send email on closure" option is automatically set/cleared based on the preference for the market when viewing a ticket.
-  A dialog is presented when "Send email on closure" is changed and differs from the market preference.
- When closing a ticket, an option to modify the asset notification is presented if the asset has a notification. This is useful for clearing notifications which have been completed or are no longer relevant upon closing the ticket.
- The entire ticket journal is now shown in the tabcontrol within the ticket editor.
- A parts inventory is now part of the tabcontrol within the ticket editor. Users can add parts to a ticket to show what parts were affected/used by the ticket. Note that this inventory does not constitute an RMA nor a shipment.
- An images section is now part of the tabcontrol within the ticket editor. Users can add images to a ticket with a note. The original OSA image is also shown here. Clicking an image will present a dialog to save it to disk.
- The rental tab will highlight yellow if a rental company is used for the current ticket.
- An RMA list is now part of the tabcontrol within the ticket editor. All linked RMAs are shown in this list as well as a button to create a new RMA. RMAs created from this button will "remember" the ticket and asset.
- A shipments list is now part of the tabcontrol within the ticket editor. All linked shipments are shown in the list as well as a button to create a new Shipment. Shipments created from this button will "remember" the ticket and asset.
- Technicians/Subcontractors which have been set to "Do Not Use" will not appear in the list when assigning a new tech to the ticket.
- If a ticket with rented equipment is closed without a valid rental pickup number, the reminder email that is sent now also includes the rental company information.

Asset Editor
- The asset editor has been redesigned to include dynamic data linking.
- Clicking a ">" button near a field will navigate to the tab or web page with more detailed information.
- New fields have been added under Physical Specifications:
- Latitude, Longitude
- Chip Type
- Computer Type
- Sign Mode/Type
- There is a button to automatically look up latitude/longitude based on the street location, city and state. (The "A" button to the left of Lat/Long when editing.) However note that this yields unusual results when given an unusual address. (It works better with actual street addresses instead of cross streets.)
- The "Set Notification" button will highlight yellow when the asset has an active notification.
- The "Create Ticket" button will highlight yellow when one or more tickets are currently open for the asset.
- Notes for the asset have been moved to the tabcontrol within the asset editor.
- Network information for the asset has been moved to the tabcontrol within the asset editor.
- Monitoring options for the asset have been moved to the tabcontrol within the asset editor.
- Assigned Techs are now viewable from the tabcontrol within the asset editor instead of from a separate form launched via button.
- More than 4 techs can now be assigned to an asset. Currently we are limiting the maximum number to 10.
- The complete ticket history for the asset it available from the tabcontrol within the asset editor. Currently open tickets are highlighted in yellow.
- All associated RMAs are shown in the RMA tab within the asset editor. Also a "Create RMA" button is available which will create an RMA and "remember" the asset.
- All associated shipments are shown in the Shipments tab within the asset editor. A "Create Shipment" button is available which will start shipment creation, and "remember" the asset.

Tech Editor
- The tech editor has been redesigned to include dynamic data linking.
- "Country" has been added to the mailing and shipping addresses for techs.
- Notes have been moved to the tabcontrol within the tech editor.
- Assigned Assets are now available on the tabcontrol within the tech editor.
- A ticket history for the tech is shown on the tabcontrol within the tech editor. By default only open tickets are shown, but the radio buttons in the control bar allow closed tickets to be shown.
- All associated RMAs are shown in the RMA tab within the tech editor. Also a "Create RMA" button is available which will create an RMA and "remember" the tech.
- All associated shipments are shown in the Shipments tab within the tech editor. A "Create Shipment" button is available which will start shipment creation, and "remember" the tech.

Web Viewer
- No changes.

Market Viewer
- The Market List has been improved and loads faster.

Search
- Ticket and Issue Search has been combined. If a search term is found more than once, a list is presented.
- Asset and Panel Search has been combined. If a search term is found more than once, a list is presented.
- Each editor has its own incorporated search which has the same functionality as the above search tools.
- Search All can be used to search additional fields such as location and contact name. For example,  searching for "Greg" will find tech companies with "Greg" as a contact, as well as any assets that might be on "Gregory Street" etc.

Reports
- Reports are non-functional in this release. They will be up and running in the next update. (Soon!)

RMA
- The RMA screens are now on their own form, which allows for multiple monitor use and simultaneous use of the ticket tracker and its tabs.
- The RMA form should remember its position after closing and reopening the application.
- All RMAs require a ticket. If you need to create an RMA for parts that are not associated with a ticket, you will have to open a ticket first.
- Some minor changes to RMA have been made for compatibility with the current version, but the RMA section is being overhauled in the next update. (So consider the current RMA functionality temporary.)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-06-24 1.1.4.4

This update adds zone information for received RMA shipments.


RMA: Job Log

    A combobox "Zone" has been added to each part line allowing the indication of what zone a shipment is stored in.
    The confirmation to close the RMA will disallow closing if no repair type has been selected for each part.

RMA: Detail

    The "Zone" field has been added after Received date.
    Fields have a slight blue tint to show the field boundary (making cropped information more obvious).

SQL Database

    The rma table has had the following fields added (all are CHAR(1)):
        zone_1
        zone_2
        zone_3
        zone_4
        zone_5

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-06-20 1.1.4.3

This update allows the alert list to show only alerts for assets with valid labor warranty or contracts.


Alert List

    The alert list now shows only alerts for assets with valid labor warranty or contracts. A checkbox allows all expired assets to be included.
    The number of alerts shown on the monitoring/alert button is the total number of alerts for assets with valid labor warranty or contracts only.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-06-15 1.1.4.2

This update primarily adds the ability to mark labor contracts as "monitoring-only."


Asset: General

    Rearranged the asset panel slightly to make room for the warranty status indicator.
    Fixed/checked tab order of controls.

Asset: Warranty

    A checkbox has been added under the labor contract dates, "Labor Contract is for Monitoring Only." This indicates that tickets for the asset cannot generate OSAs without administrator approval.
    The ticket-opening dialogues have been updated to take into account monitoring-only labor contracts.

Market

    Renamed the button "Quick Find" to "Market List" because it is more of a list than a search and it isn't that quick!

SQL Database

    Deprecated fields have been removed from all SQL tables (fields which have the _dep suffix).

        Please use the following configuration: (The password is "yesco1logan".) <image>


=====================================================================================================================================================
2011-01-07 1.1.4.0

Summary of changes:  Additional minor fixes/improvements.


Details:

    Ticket Viewer
        Rental information was being properly saved to the database but not shown properly when viewing tickets. This has been corrected.
    Rental Company Edit
        The form to edit rental companies has been updated slightly to fix a potential issue with area contacts.
    Reports
        The "Out of Date Contracts" report has a new option: "Limit to Selected Month" which, if enabled, will only show assets with expiring contracts in the selected month. If not enabled, all assets with expiring contracts up to and including the selected month are shown.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-12-30 1.1.3.9

Summary of changes:  Additional minor fixes.


Details:

    Ticket Creation
        The "OSA Comments" field character limit has been increased to 1024 (from 100).
        If an asset requires supervisor authorization to open a ticket, pressing "Cancel" could result in an exception. This was because some data was still attempted to be collected on the asset after pressing "Cancel" but should have been skipped. This has been resolved.
    Ticket Viewer/Manual Ticket Creation
        The solution description field is limited to 200 characters in the database tables. The text field on these forms now is also limited to 200 to prevent unexpected truncated data.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-12-17 1.1.3.8

Summary of changes:  Small fixes for ticket creation (webcam related) and followup log history.


Details:

    Ticket Followup Log
        The ticket followup log has been updated so that multiple-line followups are dynamically sized and will not clip portions of followups.
    Ticket Creation
        Fixed a problem which was preventing the camera images from being added to tickets.
        Added a small notification that camera download is in progress when "Attach Webcam Image" is pressed.
        Improved the error dialog for occasions that the camera download fails.
        Removed the camera channel selection, it is always "Auto." To change the channel the image is obtained from, edit the default channel for the asset first.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-12-16 1.1.3.7

Summary of changes:  Additional minor fixes.


Details:

    Markets Tab / Market Configuration Editor
        When creating new markets and adding new email to the list of addresses, the market configuration editor adds an additional blank email which later causes problems. This has been corrected.
    Reports
        The report "Company - By Market" will now list the markets alphabetically.
    Search
        If a deleted or nonexistent ticket number is searched for via the Ticket search option, no error message is displayed. If the ticket was deleted, a blank ticket viewer is shown. An error message is now provided for both cases.
    Spare Parts / Ticket History
        When viewing spare parts or ticket history for a given asset, if no spare parts inventory exists for a display, one is created. In the recent update, I forgot to change the primary key of the spare parts table, which resulted in some displays causing an error when attempting to access spare parts or ticket history. This has been corrected. Additionally, the error message has been updated to better indicate what happened, should it happen again.
    Ticket Creation
        The first tech in the list of assigned techs to the asset is automatically selected by default when creating a new ticket. (Instead of none being selected.)
    Ticket Viewer
        When closing a ticket or sending a close email (using the Send Email button), an internal error prevented the email from being sent. This has been corrected.
        Additional exceptions have been added to the email sending methods to help differentiate between the following types of error:
            Error with outgoing server authentication, such as incorrect username/password, etc.
            Error with customer or tech email addresses being invalid
            Errors related to attachments such as OSA

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-12-14 1.1.3.6

Summary of changes:  Addresses problems that were found in the 1.1.3.5 build.


Details:

    General
        The update and restart functionality has been rewritten. At some point in our conversion to Visual Studio 2010 the update and restart process was corrupted.
        Disabled update checking while program is running (it will only check at startup).
        Several lists throughout the database were not properly being populated. This was because of the faulty update/restart module. It should be corrected now. (RMA tech lists, shipping form, etc).
    Markets Tab / Market Configuration Editor
        The zip code field has been extended to 6 characters to accommodate Canadian postal codes.
    Search
        The panel field will once again search for partial panel numbers. If more than one panel matches the partial string, a dialog is presented indicating that multiple matches were found.
    Shipping Form
        The UPS shipping types "# Selected" and "Saturday Delivery" were not being saved correctly and therefore display incorrectly on the shipping form once it is converted to a document. (I don't know what "# Selected" is supposed to be, but for now am leaving it alone.)
        The UPS shipping types above were in different locations on the program and the document. Their program locations have been swapped to match their locations on the document.
    Ticket Viewer
        When viewing a closed ticket, the "Closed by" label could incorrectly show the currently logged in user. This has been corrected.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-12-13 1.1.3.5

Summary of changes:  Major overhaul to ticket handling. Tickets are linked to assets via unique ID, which allows renaming assets without breaking links to tickets. Open and close dates and times are internally handled differently. OSA, Open, Close and new Tech-On-Site emails have more error-checking and validation. Major overhaul to market and customer handling. Assets are linked to markets via unique ID, which allows: duplicate market names across customers (e.g. Astral and Pattison both may use the same designation for a market if they desire); panel numbers are not required to contain the market code; and renaming panels will not break the link to the market.

The initial launch of this update will require Yesco service techs to verify, update and reassign any assets that did not properly link to the newly created markets and companies. By default these assets are assigned a company labeled "**Unassigned**."

Details:

    General
        Throughout the database, the link between assets and tickets has been changed so that unique IDs are used instead of asset names. This will allow an asset name to be changed without breaking the link to its tickets.
        Throughout the database, the correlation between assets, markets, and companies has been changed so that unique IDs are used instead of panel prefixes. This will allow a panel name to be changed without breaking the link to its market. (And similarly a market name can be changed without breaking the link to the customer.)
        An inaccessible menu item for RMA navigation has been removed.
    Assets
        Company and market menus have been added to the asset screen. All assets have been matched to a market and company based on the panel number prefix. Any asset with a missing panel number, or a prefix that was not found in the old markets table, has been automatically assigned to an "**Unassigned**" customer.
        The shipped and install date fields have been changed from text entry to date entry fields.
        The "HAGL" field has been moved to the right of "Release #" to make room for Company and Market information.
        The "Subnet Mask" field (in Network Configuration) has been renamed "Subnet" and moved to the right of "Gateway IP" to make room for Company and Market information. (Note the blank space below MiniGoose IP is reserved for future network equipment, should the current database still be used when that happens...)
        You can now double click the VNC Port field to open a VNC session.
    Asset Warranty Details
        Date fields have been changed from text entry fields to date entry fields.
        The tab order has been fixed on this form.
        The asset, release number, and warranty/contract number fields have been colored because they are non-editable on this form.
    Administrative Functions
        Before deleting an asset, a check is performed to see if any non-deleted tickets exist for that asset. If so, the delete procedure will be canceled.
    Markets
        Assets were previously associated with markets strictly by the first three characters of their panel number. This has been changed so that assets are linked to markets by a unique ID.
        The Administration menu item "Email Addresses" has been changed to "Market Configuration."
        A "Market Configuration" button has been added to the markets tab which will launch the Market Configuration editor. If a market is loaded in the markets tab, it will be automatically selected upon launching the editor.
        A "Quick Find" button has been added to the markets tab which opens a tree view that shows companies, markets, their respective prefixes, and the number of assets assigned to each market. Double clicking a market (or selecting it and clicking OK) will open it in the markets tab.
    Reports
        The "cust_mapping.txt" file is no longer necessary and has been removed because the company list is now populated from the database (Market Configuration).
        The bar graph generator for reports has been altered so that all graphed problem reports would fit horizontally.
        "Problem Trend - Graph" report:
            Has been rewritten and no longer requires "group size."
            For a selected company and ticket range, assets are grouped by installation date.
            Sixteen date ranges are created to match the number of columns available in the graph.
            The number of open tickets for displays installed in the column date range increment the bar vertically.
        "Out of Date Contracts" report:
            Now shows all displays for which the warranty and contract have expired up to the date selected. If a display is known to not have a contract renewal, the expiration for its warranty or contract can be set to blank to prevent it from appearing on this report.
            Now omits market information as it is not needed by Julie.
        "New Installation Warranties" report:
            Panel and State columns have been added to the report.
    RMA
        RMA's have a new field, "Ticket Number," which allows optional linking of an RMA to a ticket. When an RMA is created from an open ticket, this field will be automatically populated. The automatic inclusion of the ticket number in the problem description for each part (using the format "QP#####") has been removed.
        Double clicking the Ticket Number field will open that ticket in the Viewer.
        Most RMA records have had the Ticket Number automatically populated by this update. The QP information remains in the problem description for reference.
        RMA's have a new field, "Customer WO#" which stores the customer work order number, if applicable. This field was added for YARG/YARP functionality but has not previously been editable or visible.
        The Customer Work Order number is now visible on the RMA Detail screen and the PDF export.
        The RMA Job Log now allows copy/paste of repair descriptions even when the RMA is Completed and not editable. (Previously the parts lines were disabled; they are now set to read-only upon completion.)
    Search All
        Double-clicking a tech in the result list will now properly open the tech details.
    Tickets (General)
        Adding followups can be completed by pressing Control+Enter in addition to clicking the submit button.
        "Tech Notes" has been removed. This was an unused field relating to tickets. (Old tickets retain the contents of this field in SQL should it ever be needed.)
        Tickets will maintain association with a particular asset even if that asset is renamed.
        The date range search for tickets now shows a status column indicating whether the ticket is open, closed, pending, or monitoring.
    Ticket List
        Tool tips are now shown for asset number, location and contractor so that if any information is too lengthy to display it can still be viewed.
        The "Closed" status correctly shows when tickets are closed instead of "Pending" or "Monitoring" being shown on closed tickets.
        An icon is shown for "Tech On Site" and "Equipment Rental" as a reminder of those status items.
    Deleted Tickets
        The error when attempting to restore a deleted ticket has been corrected. The deleted tickets table has been merged with normal tickets to remove redundant and hard-to-maintain code. Deleted tickets are now stored just as a normal ticket, but they use an indicator field to designate whether they are deleted or not. Deleted tickets will not appear on any ticket lists and must be accessed through the "View Deleted Tickets" menu option.
        A new button, "List All Deleted Tickets" has been added to the Deleted Tickets form. This shows a list of all deleted tickets ordered in reverse chronological order so that it is easier to find deleted tickets (instead of having to remember a deleted ticket number). Double-clicking a deleted ticket in the list will load its details.
        The administrative "Manually Add Ticket" option has had the following changes:
            The OSA suffix number field has been removed.
            The ability to manually enter an asset name has been removed. (Select from drop-down list only.)
            The ability to specify a ticket number has been removed because ticket numbers are auto-assigned and auto-incremented.
            The date received and date closed values default to the current time and date.
    Ticket Viewer
        Open and Close Dates and Times have each been combined into a single date-time field.
        Closing a ticket now requires clicking a "Closed" check box above the closed date. Doing so will automatically fill in the current date and time, but you can change it if needed. Note: Setting a Pending ticket to NO will automatically check the box and enter the date and time at which pending was originally set.
        After adding a followup or toggling the monitoring status, the ticket information is updated. Previously the log and monitoring status did not fully redraw the ticket with the updated information.
        Fixed some issues with Pending/Monitoring where in some cases tickets could exist as both Pending and Monitoring. Putting a ticket into monitoring will cancel Pending. Conversely, before a ticket can be put into Pending, it must first have Monitoring toggled off.
        A followup is automatically generated when changing a ticket to or from Pending.
        Followups for Email notifications now specify whether they are for OPEN or CLOSE.
        Followups are added for Email notifications that are re-sent (Open, Close, OSA) from the Ticket Viewer. Also, the notifications specify whether the Open email specified the current time or the original ticket open time.
        Sending OSA notifications generates the OSA on the fly. If the OSA failed to create properly, an email could be sent using the old OSA which can result in a newly assigned tech receiving an OSA that specifies the previous tech. New measures have been implemented which ensure that OSA creation is successful before sending via email. In the event of a failure, the user is shown a dialog and the email procedure is canceled.
        When changing techs, followups are automatically added for:
            When the tech is changed,
            If the tech is sent a new OSA, or
            If the user declines to send the new OSA
        If one or more RMA's have been created that associate with the ticket, a list of those RMA's can be found in the new "RMA" section.
        An inaccessible button, picturebox, and respective code was removed from the Ticket Viewer. (OSA Details / Image)
        The "Cam" button has been updated so that the web viewer opens the correct camera IP address and shows a still image. (Previously it fell behind with additions of new camera-related data to the database.) Note that only AXIS and Panasonic camera servers are currently implemented. (Olympus Media is Panasonic, everything else is AXIS.)
        The "VNC" button has been updated so that the correct information is passed to Tight VNC Client. (Previously it fell behind with additions of new network data to the database.)
            NOTE: Port 5800 by default is used by Tight VNC Server for its Javascript-based VNC service. Port 5900 is the default for normal VNC client connections. To make use of this button, displays with "5800-5900" as the VNC port will need to be edited so that 5900 is the port. (VNC does not use a port range as "5800-5900" implies.)
        When clicking "Tech on-site" checkbox, the ticket is updated immediately. The ticket viewer is now also refreshed immediately.
        The currently assigned tech name will appear in "Tech on-site" log entries.
        When "Tech on-site" is checked, an email is sent to the customer (market email list) if, on the market configuration, send email for tech on-site is enabled.
            If one of the ticket symptoms is "All Out" the Tech-On-Site email is worded as follows:

            The YESCO certified subcontractor has arrived on site to service the outage at this panel. This ticket was opened as an "ALL OUT", and the PC might need to be replaced during this visit. If you need content loaded, you will need to be at your PC. If you have questions or concerns please contact us and reference the YESCO ticket number.

            Otherwise the Tech-On-Site email is worded:

            The YESCO certified subcontractor has arrived on site to service the outage at this panel. If you have questions or concerns please contact us and reference the YESCO ticket number.

        There is now an "Export Ticket" button which will export ticket details and all followup history to a file.
    Ticket (Create)
        Additional error detail is provided if the OPEN or OSA emails fail to send.
        After creating a new ticket, the ticket is shown in the tracker list.
    Techs
        A new button, "View List" has been added to enable quickly viewing the tech list.
        Tech Status is now in a "Tech Status" group and has a key to identify colors used in lists.
        Tech Names and Telephone Numbers have been rearranged slightly.
        "Additional Information" has been enlarged.
    Web Viewer
        The Web Viewer tab has been updated and overhauled slightly.
            There now are radio buttons to select whether the webcam or the PrismView System/Server page is desired.
            There is now a refresh and a stop button that provide the same functionality as in a web browser.
            If the page cannot be loaded or the network address cannot be reached, the stop button will not immediately respond. Wait a few seconds for the connection attempt to time out.
            There is now a progress bar to indicate page loading status.

    Known Issues
        The monitoring and alerts will soon be separate from the service database because of the way PVM3 works. The links between alerts and assets are still based on the asset name. This could cause some alerts to fail to show the asset when double-clicked on.
        Even though asset names can be changed and use a separate unique key, they must still be unique. An error message will be presented if an asset name is attempted to be saved or updated that already exists.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-10-06 1.1.3.4

Summary of changes:  More relevant data is used on shipping forms. RMA/Parts Orders are marked when shipping forms are created for them. Notes fields for RMAs are labeled and displayed more consistently.

Details:

    General
        Usernames will show first name plus last initial to prevent ambiguity between users with the same first name.
    RMA
        When creating a shipment from the RMA Job Log, the Shipment will use the logged on name of the user rather than the name who created the RMA. The shipment date will be the current date and time rather than the date when the RMA was created.
        Special Requests has been renamed "Customer Requests."
        Yesco Notes and Customer Requests will now be visible on all of the following RMA screens: Create, Edit, Job Log, and Detail.
    Parts Orders
        The parts orders list has a new column "Ship. Form" which indicates whether a shipping form has already been created for a given parts order.
        If a user creates a shipping form by using the "Create Shipment" button on the RMA Job Log screen, the RMA will automatically be updated to indicate that a shipping form has been created. Some notes:
            This update can not be reversed.
            The RMA is updated when the form is created regardless of whether it is printed.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-09-01 1.1.3.3

Summary of changes: Additional equipment fields provided for each asset to better track network equipment.

Details:

    Search
        If multiple results are found when searching for an issue number, the multiple search results window is brought up instead of the Ticket Viewer simply showing the first ticket having the issue number.
    Assets
        Moved the Monitoring section to the right column. Decreased size for Additional Information and increased size for Network Configuration.
        Added fields for IBoot and MiniGoose IP addresses.
        Added validation for all IP address and port fields. If specific conditions apply, leave blank and include note in "Additional Information."
        Added buttons to view previous and next asset (alphabetically).
    Ticket Creation
        The OSA document attached to OPEN emails has been revised to include the accounts payable email address.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-19 1.1.3.2

    Bug fixing: RMA Reports.



Detailed Changes / Fixes

    Reports
        Some RMA Reports were not correctly identifying closed/open RMAs. This has been corrected.


To Do

    There is still a bug that sometimes comes up when closing the database, which gives a null reference exception. It has something to do with attempting to close a connection to the SQL Server that was already closed. Other than this dialog is not causing any issues.
    Tickets that were closed in Monitoring status still show Monitoring, even though they are closed.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-16 1.1.3.1

    Bug fixing. Shipping form automation from RMA. Added RMA report for engineering.

	
Detailed Changes / Fixes

    General
        The global search button has been named "Search All."
        On Search All results list, the techs results did not properly show the city column. This has been corrected.
        A long-existing bug allows pending tickets to be simultaneously pending and closed. While not causing issues, it is difficult to write queries that work with closed or pending tickets independently. All tickets that are closed and pending have been changed to no longer be pending. Also pending tickets will show up in the daily tracker until the pending status is turned off.
    Daily Tracker (Ticket List)
        The "View All" section of the ticket list has been modified to show all tickets created within the past 7 days and any tickets that are still open.
        The "Closed" section of the ticket list has been modified to show all tickets closed within the past 7 days instead of closed tickets created within the past 7 days.
        Tooltips have been added to some buttons and fields of the Ticket List screen.
    Assets
        When adding or changing a notification for an Asset, a null value error would sometimes occur. This has been fixed.
        A new field "Customer View" has been added which indicates that an asset is eligible for customer view on the upcoming service database replacement.
        The Assets screen has been redesigned to make room for the above field, but also to expand the Additional Info section.
        The Dashboard button has been moved to the bottom row of buttons and a label added.
        Tooltips have been added to some buttons and fields of the Asset screen.
        The network-related data in the "Sign Specifications" group have been moved to the "Network Configuration" group.
    Shipping Form
        The shipping form has been redesigned slightly with some of the other changes affecting how it is populated.
        The Asset Search field has been enabled and now finds shipments based on Asset Number. Note that this is based on the Job Number entered on the shipment, so if the shipment lacks this information, no result will be found.
        The shipping form should open in the center of the database window now instead of random locations.
        A new field indicates whether the shipment is tied to a Risk Kit or Advanced Parts Replacement RMA.
        The printed shipping document prefixes the RMA number with "RK" or "APR" depending on type of RMA.
        The "Find" asset button has been renamed to "Lookup" and now properly reports if the asset was not found.
        If more parts are added to the inventory list than it will accept, an error message is now provided.
    RMA
        There is a new button, "Create Shipment," on the RMA Job Log screen which will assist in creating a shipping form based on the information about an RMA. Note that this opens the shipping form and populates it with relevant data, but the user will need to create the final document before emailing or printing it.
        Added vertical scroll bars to the Repairs field under Job Log.
    Reports
        A new report, "RMA - Engineering" has been added to the Reports section. This report accepts a list of RMA Numbers and creates a spreadsheet of various data related to the component and parts usage by bench technicians performing repairs. It can also be saved as a comma-delimited file (which Excel can open) by clicking the "Export" button.
    Ticket Viewer
        A new symptom, "Preventive Maintenance" has been added to the symptom choices.
        The "Time to Close" field has been formatted to match that of the ticket list.
        Selecting Pending "Yes" will store the current date and time (not visible on the form) and clear the closed date fields. It will also disable the closed date fields such that the ticket cannot be closed until it is no longer in pending.
        Selecting Pending "No" will enable the closed date fields and populate them with the previously set pending date/time. (If necessary the date and time of closing can then be edited.)
        Clicking the Date Closed field while blank will populate it (and the Time Closed) with the current date and time. If there is already a date and time present, clicking it will no longer do this. Instead, it will be editable as normal.
        Double-clicking the Date Closed field will clear it and the Time Closed fields.
        Double-clicking the Asset Number field will open that Asset in the Asset tab.
        Double-clicking the Panel Number field will open that Asset/Panel in the Asset tab.
        Double-clicking the Tech Company field will open that Tech in the Techs tab.
    Misc
        An additional data field "wb_live" has been added to the assets table to assist with the transition to the upcoming service database replacement. This field is not visible from the application.


To Do

    There is still a bug that sometimes comes up when closing the database, which gives a null reference exception. It has something to do with attempting to close a connection to the SQL Server that was already closed. Other than this dialog is not causing any issues.
    Tickets that were closed in Monitoring status still show Monitoring, even though they are closed.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-12 1.1.3.0

Adjusted field lengths for warranty-related data, added a new search option.


Changes / Fixes

    General
        A new search field has been added which searches assets, tickets, issues, techs and the kitchen sink. Try it out!t
    Assets
        The fields for parts W/C, labor W/C, and release number now accept 10 characters.
    Techs
        When adding a new Tech, if the record cannot be added, a more descriptive error message is provided in the dialog.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-07 1.1.2.9

Bug squishing.


Changes / Fixes

    Tickets
        The database will now properly validate the list of destination emails when closing a ticket, which should prevent the lack of closure emails being sent.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-02 1.1.2.8

Minor bug squishing.


Changes / Fixes

    Parts Orders
        The shipping column now displays the correct shipping type on parts orders.
    RMAs
        When opening a closed RMA that does not have repair types set in the pull-down menus, instead of getting a warning that you cannot update an RMA without a selected reason, it will allow you to open the RMA. Note that in order to close it again, you must set repair types.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-02 1.1.2.7

Big fix for new RMAs.


Changes / Fixes

    RMAs
        A bug was preventing the display name from being saved properly when new RMAs are created. This has been fixed.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-07-01 1.1.2.6

Labor/Parts Warranty/Contract changes throughout.


Changes / Fixes

    General
        Due to recent changes with release numbers, the old database structure of warranty and contract numbers is not working properly. A solution was proposed by Julie Johnstun in providing a way to specify the current warranty or contract number for labor and parts, rather than having a warranty and contract field which leaves ambiguous whether the specified number pertained to parts or warranty.
        The old Warranty field is now Parts W/C which will refer to the current parts warranty or contract, whichever is current.
        The old Contract field is now Labor W/C which will refer to the current labor warranty or contract, whichever is current.
        Tickets and OSA's that deal with labor will use the Labor W/C field.
        RMA's that deal with parts will use the Parts W/C field.
        The warranty dialog that shows dates for the warranty and contract valid periods has been redesigned to show the asset number, release number, and the Labor W/C and Parts W/C fields.
    Search
        When searching for an issue number or ticket number, the database would sometimes throw an exception instead of showing a "Not Found" dialog. This has been corrected.
        When searching for a ticket, issue, asset, panel, or tech, the "Not Found" dialog now properly references the type of search that was performed.
    Shipping Form
        RMA number is saved and populated on the shipping form properly.
        The search for RMA number function is improved and works correctly.
        The search for Job number function is improved and works correctly.
        The Clear All Data button now properly clears the package contents and resets radio buttons.
        Added a note to the search results screen indicating to click outside the search result list (in the event no items were found) to return to the previous screen.
        Field max lengths have been adjusted to match the SQL table.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-06-30 1.1.2.5

Bug fixes.

Changes / Fixes

    RMA Section
        Create/Edit
            The bug preventing creation of an RMA due to an error with the Display Name has been fixed.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-06-29 1.1.2.4

Some fixes on the RMA features introduced in the last update, plus a new feature which auto-populates the job number based on selected display when creating an RMA.

Changes / Fixes

    RMA Section
        Create/Edit
            Changed Display Name to a drop down list of assets.
            The Job Number field will auto-populate when an asset is selected.
                Transposed the position of Display Name and Job Number.
            There is a link to refresh the list of displays, in case the desired display is not present in the list.
        Lists/Reports
            The RMA's listed in "RMA by Tech" were not properly showing open/closed status, this has been corrected
    Assets: Ticket History
        Double-clicking a ticket in the ticket history will no longer result in a "ticket not found" error.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-06-29 1.1.2.3

Overhaul to RMA section to incorporate new YARG/YARP features. Fields have been changed to match the underlying SQL structure to prevent some future issues, as well as adjusted to make data entry faster and easier.

Changes / Fixes

    General
        The Parts Orders button location near the top right of the main window is now linked to a new feature of the automated RMA system. Whenever an Advanced Replacement RMA or Risk Kit RMA is received, this button will indicate that a parts order is in queue. Click it to view the list of pending parts orders. In order to clear an item from the list you must update the corresponding RMA with a tracking number of the outgoing shipment.
    RMA Section
        Navigation/Interface
            Removed an unreachable tab on the RMA screen ("Main").
            Rearranged the RMA buttons "Edit," "Job Log," and "Detail" such that they are in consistent locations.
            Converted the various RMA Create/Edit/Log/Detail screens to use custom controls rather than individual labels for data display. (Performance/editing improvement.)
            Parts lines on the various RMA screens will be gray or disabled depending on the part quantity to make it easier to determine how many parts are on a given RMA.
            Editing an RMA is disabled for closed RMA's. An RMA must be re-opened to enable editing.
        "No Return" on Parts:
            Customers using YARG are now given the option to select "No Return" for a part. This will allow customers to request a new part for situations where they do not have a part to return for repair. (Such as theft, destruction, or items too heavy to ship cost-effectively.) They are prompted for a reason for the selection, and must enter a note. When RMA requests are received that contain a "No Return" they are assigned an RMA number but that number is not sent to the customer immediately. A Yesco service representative must review and approve the RMA request. Once the request is approved, the customer will receive the RMA number. By default, these types of RMA are considered parts orders and are shown in the parts order list.
            An RMA requiring "No Return" approval now has an approval mechanism in the Edit RMA screen. The reason for the parts not being returned is provided and the user may select Cancel, Deny or Approve. Deny will mark the "No Return" request as denied, which will generate an email requesting the customer to contact Yesco Electronics. Approve will mark the "No Return" request as approved and will send the assigned RMA number to the customer. Note that "Deny" does not cancel, suspend or delete the RMA, it simply marks it so that Yesco Service knows that the customer request to not return parts has been denied and the RMA still needs to be resolved.
        Create/Edit
            The list of parts on the RMA create/edit screens has been updated with additional parts. They have been sorted alphabetically with the exception of LED Boards and LED Power Supplies which are still at the top of the list.
            The "Repair Needed" boxes now accept a maximum of 200 characters.
            Reorganized the RMA Create and Edit screens so that a given RMA only has one job number and one display name. (An RMA must only be associated with one asset.) When viewing old RMA's that were assigned to multiple assets, the old job number and display name will be displayed on their corresponding part line in orange highlights. The individual job numbers and display names on such RMA's can no longer be modified.
            The Create/Edit RMA screens now have checkboxes to indicate that the RMA is for Advanced Parts Replacement or Risk Kit.
            When editing/updating an RMA the confirmation dialog now shows the RMA number.
        Job Log
            When modifying an RMA in the Job Log, if a repair type has not been selected the user will be prompted to select a repair type.
            When modifying an RMA in the Job Log, if the RMA has not been completed, the user will be prompted with a dialog asking if they would like to complete the RMA. If the completed yes/no options have been clicked prior to clicking "Enter Information" the prompt does not appear.
            The repairs fields in the Job Log now accepts a maximum of 400 characters and is a normal text field rather than a rich text field.
            The Tech and Returned By fields are now formatted uppercase and accept a maximum of 50 characters.
            The Date Received and Date Returned fields now auto format dates and provide a calendar interface (normal date field functionality).
            The MU fields in the Job Log now accept a maximum of 10 characters.
            The Return Tracking Number fields in the Job Log now accept a maximum of 20 characters.
            The Display Name fields in the Job Log have been removed.
            The Job Log now has a Job Number and Display Name field at the top of the form. These fields are read-only.
            The Job Log shows "APR" for Advanced Parts Replacement or "RK" for Risk Kit in a large label on each part.
            A tooltip has been added to the RMA Job Log for the part description, which shows the part problem.
            The Completed Yes/No section highlights green if the RMA is completed.
            For RMAs which are Advanced Parts Replacements or Risk Kit Fulfillment, if a tracking number has not been entered for each part type, a dialog will remind users that shipment tracking numbers are needed to clear the RMA from the Parts Order list.
        Lists/Reports
            The RMA's listed in "RMA by Tech" are gray if closed, matching the other RMA lists.
        Misc
            RMA records now use a boolean instead of a string to indicate whether they are closed or not.
    Tickets
        When opening a ticket for an asset, if a ticket is already open for that asset, the open ticket check fails if the currently open ticket has a comma in the description field for "other symptom." This issue has been fixed.
    Asset Viewer
        The city and state fields are now fully separate. Please do not include the state name in the city field unless it is a foreign country.
        A new checkbox, "Pingable," has been added next to the HTTP port. This toggles whether the display can be pinged (which is useful in determining connectivity for monitoring and diagnostics).
    Assets: Spare Parts
        The spare parts inventory for assets now properly saves and retrieves counts of spare parts. However, it no longer subtracts parts that are in the RMA inventory from the available spares count. This functionality requires significant reworking that will best be left to the replacement database.
    Assets: Ticket History
        The ticket history was sometimes showing incorrect dates for tickets opened, this has been fixed.
    Search
        Fixed and updated the Find Issue search function. (It was not functioning properly in cases where multiple tickets have the same issue number.)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-06-07 1.1.2.2

Changes / Fixes

    Asset Viewer
        The HTTP Port field accepts 5 characters, instead of 3.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-06-01 1.1.2.1

Changes / Fixes

    Asset Viewer
        Assets with invalid data for spare parts inventory would sometimes prevent the ticket history from being shown. The spare parts inventory data is now checked, and if invalid, default values are used.
    Tickets
        Added "Preventive Maintenance" to the selectable solutions when closing a ticket.
        OSA emails now include a PDF attachment which outlines required tools and equipment for performing service.
    General
        The RMA and Monitoring buttons near the top right have been resized to make room for a new button, "Parts Orders." This feature will be implemented soon.
        Hidden SQL connection controls and methods that were used for debugging only have been removed.

2010-04-21 1.1.2.0

Changes / Fixes

If you receive a message indicating that the customer file could not be loaded after installing the update, please close and re-open. The customer file is not being loaded properly immediately following the update.

    Reports
        Reports that require an asset number but were not showing the field for the asset number have been fixed.
        The report selector has been revamped so that instead of having separate report selections for various companies, better logic is implemented to determine company and market for assets.

        Problems by Company, All Tickets (Weekly), All Tickets (Monthly), By Market, Daily Open, and Open Duration reports all now use a company selector rather than being limited to Clear Channel, Lamar, Marsys, etc.

        A text file is now used to control the list of available companies and asset prefixes. This file, "cust_mapping.txt" resides in the Yesco Service Database folder and can be edited to accommodate new companies. It is not a final solution, but provides some of the linking that was otherwise missing. To edit the file, double-click the "Company" label above the selection on applicable reports. The file affects all reports that utilize a company selection.


        The Open Duration Report no longer has an empty "close date" column. It also shows the open duration instead of total time open (because total time open relies on a close date/time).

        The "Generate Report" buttons now change to "Please Wait" while long reports are being generated so there is some feedback that the report is taking time to create.

        Buttons and fields now appear/disappear according to the type of report selected to help decrease confusion about which apply.

        The date/time ranges for reports that use it now select from midnight of the first day to 11:59 pm of the last day selected. (Previously the current time was used for the first day but not the last day.)

        The bar graph has had bar labels adjusted to always be above the bar, particularly on low values. (Plus other minor cosmetic changes.)

        The "Group Size" for the report "Problem Trend - Graph" is directly related to how many assets a customer has. It now auto-populates with a suggested size when the company selector is changed.

        The date range selectors change to match when an auto-range button is clicked (such as Weekly, Monthly, etc.)

        Displays that do not belong to a defined market are categorized as "Default Market" instead of "Unknown" on the "Company - By Market" report.

        The Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Annual/Manual reports now all share the same code to generate reports. (This should eliminate some minor discrepancies in formatting that existed between them.)

        The Problem Trend vs other graphed reports now share the same code to generate graphs. (Again to eliminate some minor discrepancies between them.)

        If no records exist for a specified date range, a dialog indicating such is presented.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-03-25 1.1.1.9

Changes / Fixes

    Asset Display
        Added new field "Release Number" which is prepopulated with Warranty number. This will be used for conversion to the new database.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-03-17 1.1.1.8

Changes / Fixes

    General
        Removed references to a deprecated progress bar for populating techs, assets, etc. that was causing unhandled exceptions.
        Fixed current date display format (comma after day, not month) and time format (24 hour instead of 12 hour).
    Reports
        A new report "RMA - By Asset" has been added to the reports section. It generates a small report showing which RMA's are open and closed for a particular asset.
    Ticket List
        Changed ticket list boxes internally to use a template-like system instead of individual components.
    Misc.
        Removed deprecated code to simplify some things.
        Updated MySQL data library from 6.0.3.0 to 6.2.2.0.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-03-04 1.1.1.7

Changes / Fixes

    Ticket List
        Open and Pending tickets show the correct number of tickets and pages. (A counter was not being updated so the total tickets shown in the category were limited to fewer than should be.)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-03-03 1.1.1.6

Changes / Fixes

    Ticket List
        Open and Pending tickets are now combined in one view.
    Ticket Creation/Editing
        When assigning an alternate tech, the Escape key can now be used to cancel the change.
    Automatic Refresh
        The "On Line" indicator now has a light green background to indicate that automatic refreshes are enabled.
        Increased the frequency of automatic refreshes from 5 minutes to 2 minutes.
    General
        Changed outgoing email from "eletech2@yesco.com" to "hcook@yesco.com" where applicable.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-02-02 1.1.1.5

Changes / Fixes

    Asset List
        Fixed the Asset List where IP Addresses were being shown in the City column. (I always try to sneak one typo into each release!)
    Reports
        The Coke/Marsys Report by Market was looking for a company named "Coke/Marsys" when it should have just been "Marsys." It now properly finds the company.
    Opening Tickets
        When opening a ticket, a check is made if other tickets are currently open for the asset. If true, a dialog is displayed with some of the details of those tickets. If the open date of those tickets use single-digit months and days, a "Parse Error" would be shown as the open date. This has been corrected.
        When OSA and OPEN emails are sent upon opening a ticket, a dialog indicating what was sent is shown. In the past this dialog has not provided any detail about why an email was not sent. It now provides a bit more detail when email fails to send.
    Assets
        A new field, State, has been added so that eventually the City and State values will be separable (for sorting and reports, and future Market fixes).

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-02-01 1.1.1.4

Changes / Fixes

    Reports
        The "Out of Date Contracts" report generated error messages with blank values for some dates with respect to warranty and contract information. This has been corrected so that the report converts blank values correctly.
        The following reports have been added:
            By Company - Coke/Marsys
            All Tickets (Weekly) - Coke/Marsys
            All Tickets (Monthly) - Coke/Marsys
            Coke/Marsys - By Market
            Daily Open - Coke/Marsys
    General
        Some minor changes were made to tech and asset lists to process null values in the database faster. Some screens may load slightly faster due to the change.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2010-01-04 1.1.1.3

Changes / Fixes

    Assets
        The additional information text box is now limited to 1024 characters (instead of 450 as previous).
        There is now a HAGL (height above ground level) field.
    Techs
        There is now a pull-down menu which allows assignment of a tech's status. Also on lists of techs the color code represents the status.
            Trained - Green
            Untrained - Yellow
            OEM - Red
            Do Not Use  - Black
            Unassigned - Gray

The previous email regarding version 1.1.1.3 listed the color codes for techs incorrectly. The color codes should be as follows:

Tech Color Codes

    Trained - Green
    Untrained - Red
    OEM - Yellow
    Do Not Use  - Black
    Unassigned - Gray

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-12-30 1.1.1.2

Minor changes:

Changes / Fixes

    Tickets
        Un-deleting a ticket now works properly. (The ticket type field changed since this was last looked at.)
    Assets
        The "Show on camera checks." option has been changed to "Always show on camera checks." Camera checks by default verify that there is a valid warranty or contract, and exclude the display if not. This option will now override this verification and show the display even if its warranty/contract has expired.
        There is now a button to launch the PrismView Monitor Log Viewer. If the asset's "Monitor for problems" option is checked, the data gathered for it can be viewed with this application.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-12-01 1.1.1.1

Fix to contract date reporting.

Changes / Fixes

    Reports
        The "Out of Date Contracts" report no longer fails! (The error had to do with the expected count of assets to check being less than 1000.)
        The "Out of Date Contracts" report no longer displays a progress bar. It can take a long time to generate, so just be patient. :)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-12-01 1.1.1.0

Some minor tweaks to alerts and emails.

Changes / Fixes

    General
        OSA emails no longer are copied to Julie Johnston <jjohnston@yesco.com> when the tech is Yesco.
        The alert count on the button was incorrect: When an alert suppression expired, sometimes the alert was staying hidden when it should have become visible again.
        The alerts list now shows multiple alerts for an asset using separate lines within the second column.
    Shipping Form
        The shipping form now will accept characters such as apostrophes and quotation marks (like when used to indicate a cable length) without causing a database error.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-11-25 1.1.0.9

Oops, forgot to carry the one...

Fixes

    General
        The database will now properly show when there is ONE ticket left!

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-11-25 1.1.0.8

Minor bug fixes.

Fixes

    General
        The database will no longer have an error when 0 tickets exist for the selected ticket type. (The error mistakenly reported the connection to the database as being lost.)
    Techs
        The additional information text box will now accept 1024 characters. (Up from 300.)
        The additional information text box now has a scroll bar to indicate when more text exists than can be seen.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-11-12 1.1.0.7

This version primarily fixes some bugs with reports.

Fixes

    General
        Added some additional checks to ensure that SQL database connections are not left open.
        Changed the MySQL server wait_timeout from 8 hours to 1 minute to close idle connections in a reasonable time.
    Reports
        When generating a report By Market, sometimes the report would crash. Panels that lack a separator dash were causing the market identifier to fail, they will now properly be grouped in the "unknown market" heading.
        "All Tickets (Weekly)" (or (Monthly)) reports have been adjusted to include open tickets regardless of the date they were opened. (Previously, if opened before the date range specified, they were not included on the report.)
    Followups
        Dates and times on followups are now consistently formatted.
        When a ticket is closed or re-opened, a followup is added including the date, time and user.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-11-10 1.1.0.6

This version fixes some bugs with market emails and warranty data, adds some new features for opening tickets, and adds new categories for viewing the ticket list.

New Features / Changes

    General
        A button has been added to the top right area of the main window which provides a simple list showing the current alerts from PrismView Monitor. Future updates will include much more detailed views of monitoring data.
        Double-clicking an item in the alert list will close it and display the asset details for the corresponding asset.
    Market/Email Administration
        Right-clicking and deleting an email no longer erroneously deletes all emails (across all markets) matching it from the market email table; it deletes the email only from the currently viewed market. (This is how lddissues@lamar.com got removed from all Lamar markets in one click.)
        The market/email administration dialog is no longer resizable.
    Warranty Details
        The "Contract Start" and "Contract End" fields are obsolete and have been removed. The Labor and Parts contract fields are the only valid contract fields. (Data for the removed fields is retained in case it is needed.)
    Open Ticket
        The Open Ticket dialog has been updated to show more clearly the status of warranty and contracts.
        The image attachment section has been updated to utilize the camera channel, port and "Use LAN" settings.
        The image attachment section has an "Auto" choice for camera channel, which uses the saved information in the database.
        After clicking "Assign Alternate Tech", the list of techs will now scroll by keypress to the corresponding letter and also accepts "Enter" to select.
        When opening a ticket, if other tickets are currently open for the same asset, a dialog box will notify the user of the open tickets with the option to continue or cancel.
    Reports
        The "By Market - Lamar" now has the same "Use Date Range" option that "By Market - Clear Channel" does.
    Ticket Details
        Added a second "Update" button for convenience below the Solution which is a logical place to click after entering solution text.
    Asset Details
        The contract number now clears properly if searching for a Panel after viewing any asset that had a contract number, where the new search result does not have a contract number. (Searching by asset did not cause this problem.)
        The contract number now clears properly if searching for an asset By Location after viewing any asset that had a contract number, where the new search result does not have a contract number.
        The shipping date now clears properly if the previously viewed asset shipping date had a shipping date, but the currently viewed asset does not.
    Spare Parts
        Spare Parts now includes a line item for Dongahs and Fuse Cards; however, note that they are not automatically checked against RMA inventory at this time. (The quantity can be entered and saved but is not auto-adjusted for matching items sent in for or returned from RMA.)
    Ticket List
        Two new sub-tabs have been added to the ticket list which place Pending and Monitoring tickets on their own tabs.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-10-20 1.1.0.5

This version changes a few more items in reporting that were clarified by Steve and Syd.

New Features / Changes

    Reports
        Reports "By Market":
            changed so markets that have no tickets in the specified range are once again output as blank headers
            now show the duration from open to the present time for currently open tickets instead of zero.
            now show the number of tickets for a market just after the header.
        Added "Exclude Monitor Tickets" to "Open Duration Report" an an additional option.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-10-20 1.1.0.4

This version primarily fixes some ambiguity and omissions in the reporting section.

New Features / Changes

    Shipping
        The date range fields to search now default to use the current week instead of 4-21-2008.

    Ticket Viewer
        A "Create RMA" button has been added in the Solution section which pre-populates the Create RMA form with Tech Name, Warranty and Panel information and includes the ticket number in the description field.
        The following solutions have been added due to their frequency in manually-entered data:
            Intermittent - Not Reoccurred
            Misreported or Absent

    Reports
        Reports "By Market" have been altered so that:
            if the display city/state does not match the market city/state, it is no longer omitted from the report
            if the market city/state contains a comma it is no longer omitted from the report
            markets that have no tickets in the specified range are no longer output as blank headers
            displays that lack a proper market designation in the panel number will fall under an "Unknown Market" header
        The solution (in reports that show it) now begins with "Other: " in addition to the description text when the selected solution was "Other."
        Fixed an issue with graph reports where only one issue was being shown. (for example, Problems by Panel)
        The Status column in various reports will now differentiate between "OPEN" and "OPEN-MONITORING"
        Fixed an issue with Open Duration Report where if the field for "Open longer than (hours):" was left blank the report would crash.
        Added an option for Open Duration Report to only select Monitoring tickets.
        Open Duration Reports now include the average time at the end.

    General
        Added a Quick Launch shortcut to the installation program.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-10-14 1.1.0.3

This version fixes the overlooked Deleted Ticket section and a few other bugs.

New Features / Changes

    General
        Added shortcut keys to the main menu (Administration, Reports, etc.)
        The password field is cleared and selected if a login attempt fails.

    Daily Tracker
        The timestamp and followup text background will turn red when the followup date exceeds 24 hours on Pending Tickets as well (instead of just on open tickets).
        Performing an update will now remember whether all/closed/open tickets were being viewed.
        The View All / View Open / View Closed buttons now highlight to indicate which tickets are being viewed.
        The ticket list is refreshed after various operations which change it (such as deleting a ticket). This change should also prevent instances of viewing a blank (nonexistent) page where items have been recently closed or deleted.

    Deleted Tickets
        Edited the code that handles deleted tickets to also properly read solutions/symptoms. (Deleted tickets can now be viewed.)
        When a ticket is deleted or undeleted, a followup is now automatically added showing which user performed the action.

    Manually Entered Tickets
        The manual ticket entry form has been updated to also accommodate solutions/symptoms changes.

    Reports
        The duplicate problem display for tickets with symptom type "Other" has been corrected for the report "All Problems - Table." (Shown when a ticket is double-clicked.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-10-13 1.1.0.2

There is quite an extensive list of changes, so please let me know if any problems arise. Many of the changes were as a result of "fixing/improving A while implementing B because B depends on A."

New Features / Changes

    General
        Changed General Notes so that notes now show a date, time and user name. They are retained for a week in a scrollable list.
        Added General Notes to the list of items that get refreshed when Update is clicked and when the 5-minute refresh timer occurs.
        Rearranged the Create Ticket sidebar panel to make more room for General Notes.
        Changed the tab order of fields in various sections to have a more logical order. (Some items had been added which threw off tab order.)
        Modified how the database stores symptoms to facilitate easier addition of future symptoms.
        Modified code throughout database to process new Symptom options. (reports, ticket history, past-issue checking, etc.)
        Because OSR is no longer used, functions for OSR-related methods have not been updated. Due to how symptoms are now processed that are not implemented in OSR sections which could cause crashes, OSR has been disabled throughout the database.
        General Notes, Follow-ups, and Tech Notes all share the same update dialog which now no longer records blank entries.

    Daily Tracker
        Tech Note icons have been hidden because they are not currently in use.
        The underlying method that draws the ticket list (all, open, closed) has been rewritten to save time editing code that used to require three separate edits.
        The amount of time since the last followup is now displayed after the time stamp. (i.e. "2h 32m ago")
        The timestamp is now color-coded to indicate the age of the followup:
            No color for monitoring, pending or closed tickets
            No color for followups less than 4 hours old
            Yellow for followups less than 8 hours old
            Orange for followups less than 24 hours old
            Red for followups 24+ hours old
        After adding a followup via the "Full Log" button, the ticket list is now refreshed as when via the followup timestamp.

    Asset Details
        Rearranged the Asset Detail window to make room for new information.
        Added Monitoring section to the Asset Detail which controls:
            whether the display is monitored for problems
            if the display is being monitored, whether to ignore a current alert
            the date and time to resume issuing alerts if currently ignored
            whether its webcam images are saved
            how often webcam images are saved
            whether it is included in camera checks
        When editing an asset, the default date and time to resume issuing alerts is 24 hours from the present.
        Added HTTP port (PrismView server port) to Sign Specifications section.
        Labeled the shaded area of Network Configuration "LAN" so the fields therein are more clearly LAN-specific.
        Added button in Monitoring section to launch Dashboard with the currently viewed Asset.
        The Ticket History list now indicates currently open tickets with a yellow highlight.
        The Asset Detail window will now return to read-only mode when Update is clicked.
        The Asset Detail window will display the information for the asset instead of going to a blank form when a new asset is added.
        The Asset Detail window will now return to read-only mode when a new asset is added.

    Ticket Viewer
        Closed tickets now show the User Name as well as the ID of the user that closed the ticket.
        Added new items to the list of Solutions when closing a ticket:
            Replaced Computer
            Replaced Webcam Server
            Reset Webcam Server
            Replaced Web Camera
            Upgrade: Software
            Upgrade: Hardware
            Replaced IBoot
            Reset IBoot
        Warranty and contract numbers have been added to the ticket viewer.

    New Ticket Creation
        Added new items to the choice of Symptoms when opening a ticket:
            Webcam Issue
            Webcam Server Issue
            Computer Issue
            Software Upgrade
            Hardware Upgrade
        Limited number of selected symptoms to 5 when opening a ticket, added a dialog indicating this if additional selections are attempted.
        Added cancel button to Ticket Creation dialog.

    Reports
        Extensive modification of reporting section (charts and graphs) to accommodate new symptoms list.
        Reworked time span calculation on multiple reports, some values were causing crashes. Also values over 24 hours were truncated (not showing number of days).
        Added user name display to ticket open/close ID on the report: All Problems - Table. (Shown when a ticket is double-clicked.)
        Added new report: "RMA - Repair Types" which counts the types of repairs selected from the new Repair Type menus.

    RMA
        Added Priority to RMA Detail window.
        Added Priority to the Create PDF function for RMA Detail.
        Repair Type menus added to RMA Job Log to categorize/summarize the repairs done:
            Added Component(s)
            Adjusted Pots/Switches/Trimcaps
            Bridged/Shorted Trace
            Broken/Open Trace
            Cleaned

            Forwarded to Supplier
            Multiple Problems Repaired (See Notes)
            No Repair Needed (Tested OK)

            Replaced with Refurb
            Returned to Inventory
            Other

There was a known issue where deleting tickets it not possible. This has been corrected in the database without a version update.

However, in order to view deleted tickets there will need to be a version update. It escaped my attention to work on the part of the database that handles deleted tickets. Because the symptoms/solutions are handled differently, the deleted ticket viewer needs some changes as well.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-09-28 1.1.0.1

New Features

    The reports generated for Daily/Weekly/Monthly Ticket selections now include the solution description if "Other" was selected.
    A report showing the count of all parts entered into RMAs has been added (RMA Parts Counts)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-08-28 1.1.0.0

Despite the version number rollover from 1.0.9.9 to 1.1.0.0 this update only contains minor revisions.


New Features

    When closing a ticket, the "Other" solution no longer accepts a space character as a description of the solution.

    When a supervisor override occurs for opening a ticket, the email notifications now include sksluder@yesco.com and omit kizatt@yesco.com

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-08-13 1.0.9.9

This version adds additional functionality for RMA handling and clarifies some WAN / LAN IP addressing data.

New Features

    Users can now change the assigned tech in the Edit RMA screen from a pull-down menu of techs.

    The "Unreceived," "Unfinished," "Master List," and "RMA by Tech" screens have had the following changes:
        These pages should load faster due to changes in how the database is queried.
        The column headers can now be clicked to sort by that column.
        A key showing the meaning of the coloration of results has been added to applicable screens.
        The "Unreceived" list now properly omits RMAs that had never received parts with 0 quantity.
        The "Unfinished" list now properly omits RMAs that are also Unreceived.
        A button to export the list to a Comma Separated file has been added, which allows for printing, etc.

    Reports for Unreceived, Unfinished, and Master RMAs have been adjusted to match the above changes.

    The Asset screen's Network Configuration section has been changed to show the LAN addresses separate from the public/WAN address. The checkmark previously associated with only the webcam is now labeled "Use LAN" and applies to the LAN section. This checkmark indicates to Dashboard (and future applications) that Yesco has a connection to the LAN addresses directly, whether through a VPN or in cases where LAN addresses are actually public.

    The WAN IP Address has been extended to 40 characters to allow dynamic addresses such as <assetname>.yescobillboardlas.com

    A scrollbar has been added to Additional Information to indicate when more text exists than the size of the window allows.

2009-08-10 1.0.9.8

This version fixes some bugs related to the automated RMA processing.

Note that the web-based database used for viewing and editing RMA's is not 100% compatible with the automatically generated RMA's. If you are using the web-based viewer note that part descriptions and other details may be incorrect. There are no plans to update or change the web-based viewer as it is being phased out.

Fixes

    When viewing an RMA, the RMA Detail screen was not properly parsing the shipping dates for parts shipped from Yesco. (Lines with no parts were trying to select a nonexistent shipping method.) Lines with no parts are now properly ignored for shipping method selection.
    When editing an RMA, parts descriptions that are not part of the original database pull-down menu are added to the end of the list. However duplicate entries were being made because the pull-down menu list is persistent between RMA views. The code has been changed to check if the part in question is already in the list, and only add it if not.


New Features

    The "Auth by (Supervisor)" field that shows who created the RMA now shows the "Refer" name if auto-generated by YARP. (See YARP notes below.)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-07-22 1.0.9.7

Fixes

    Fixed a problem that would prevent creation of a new asset.
    Kicked myself for not testing that particular thing properly. :)

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-07-21 1.0.9.6

Changes

    The warranty dates will now notify you if an invalid or nonexistent date is entered, which should help prevent inconsistent determination of warranty/contract expiration.
    There is now a "Create PDF" button on the RMA Detail screen which allows for clean printing (and email).
    The RMA screens' "Print" button has been renamed to "Print Screen."
    The RMA screens' "print screen" functionality no longer print the buttons of the form.
    The RMA Detail screen has had adjustments made to field lengths, font sizes, font colors and alignments.
    Warranty information no longer requires supervisor permission for editing if the logged in user is already an administrator.
    The current page number after clicking "View All," "View Open," or "View Closed" is now corrected.
    Assets now have a field for the camera channel. This data is not used by the Web Viewer tab, but will be used by Dashboard and future programs.


Note: Major changes will not be made to the existing database because they will be implemented in a replacement database.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-07-10 1.0.9.5

New Features

    Some additional functionality to handle automated RMA processing was added in 1.0.9.3 and 1.0.9.4.
    The RMA Edit, Detail and Job Log screens now have a "Print" button which prints the RMA screen to a printer.
    The RMA Detail screen has been adjusted so that data is displayed in a different color (dark blue) from the labels.
    First and Last page buttons have been added to the Ticket View.
    When reassigning a tech for an open ticket, the list is now keyboard-accessible.
    A "Find Tech" search field has been added to the right column.
    Some minor cosmetic changes to clickable labels and text windows.


Fixes

    Revisited (and re-fixed) a problem where Monitoring tickets were incorrectly processed after viewing them by "Find Issue" (rather than "Find Ticket").
    Optimized some of the processing of the list of techs when the "Update" button is clicked. (A delay and flicker was occurring on certain screens.)
    The RMA Detail screen will no longer display placeholder labels if a particular RMA cannot be shown.

=====================================================================================================================================================
2009-06-10 1.0.9.2

New Features
The ability to change a ticket to Monitoring, or turn off Monitoring is now available. On the ticket details screen there is now a button which toggles the Monitoring status. See the image "YDB_1092a.jpg"  If the asset has expired warranty (or blank fields) it will require supervisor permission to disable Monitoring, just as if the ticket was being created. Please note that if you turn off Monitoring with the intention of sending OSA's and Open email notifications, you will need to do so manually.

Fixes
Occasionally the page number view at the bottom of the daily tracker will display erroneous information, such as "Page 12 of 4." This has been fixed.

10/05/07
Show UserID somewhere.
Make sure when tech is changed on the ticket, that the OSA is also changed.

09/09/07
Need to be able to select a tech from the ticket form (Any tech not just from dropdown).
Need to change the way techs are selected in tracker. This way if the name is changed the tracker will update too.
Make sure you can opt-out of sending the E-Mail on ticket creation.
Add the ability to change the tech on a ticket that is already open.

09/06/07
Impersonate not required.  Coding from frmTicket can be taken out.

09/05/07
Search Date range needs to be completed on the daily tracker.
Pending status for the tracker needs to be added. I think this is the last addition to bring it up to par.

09/04/07
Add the combobox for set fixes on the FSOs. If 'Other' is selected, force the use of solution notes.

08/23/07
Add more parts to the RMA create and Edit lists.
Add the combobox for set fixes on the FSOs.
Fixed several RMA bugs - Added try/catch to almost all fields.

08/21/07
When viewing OSA do a try catch for new type OSA and then try catch in the catch of the try to load up the old type.

08/18/07
Changed the way followup is recorded.  The new way logs each persons addition and displays in log form.

08/05/07
Times on viewing ticket keep dropping the 0!  Make it stop! - Changed the way the time is grabbed from the system.

08/02/07
Had tickets update the status on screen as soon as the ticket is updated.

08/01/07
When pulling image (Creating ticket) disable the 'Create Ticket' until the worker completes.
Add logging of the user who closes the ticket as this was just added to my web database.
Add textbox to enable users to enter an Asset number and have the webviewer go right to it.

07/30/07
Changed the string used to display the time to complete a ticket.  Current one was too long.  Also changed the formatting.
When Ticket is created,  ViewOpenTickets() is now called to refresh main page.
When TechNote is created, the technote void allocates the new image.  Checks for null value to determine correct image.
When no warranty, add 'NA' for OSA to display correctly. (Added to code now so it may have been done...Test with Asset 'T1'. --This has been completed and verified.)
Maybe set the sending of E-Mail to be done with a background worker as the program holds while it sends. Only downside will be that any errors will be shown a little later. --This has now been put in place.
Check to see if E-Mails can be sent using IP address as this seemed to have been an issue previously. (Reolsution was simply to re-configure teh SMTP server.  A test with this did work.
** OSA occurence (LM001-2) needs to increase when created. ** -- Completed.

07/27/07
Completed Tech Notes
Only one tech note will now appear at a time.
Checked for the bug that made any computer NOT in my workgroup to error out.  Seems the impersonate function is actually not needed.  It returns error invalid username/password.
I am wondering of impersonator goes by local usernames from where the program is run...Need to check that.
Added time taken calculation to the ticket viewer on frmMain - done.

07/26/07
Follow Up is checked for 24 hr period update.
Follow Up now turns red if 24 hrs have passed.
Initial Tech note placement and SQL search is now in place.
